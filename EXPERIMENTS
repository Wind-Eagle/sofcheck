Some insane experiments to be conducted to optimize the move generator performance:
- Cells: uint8_t vs uint32_t
- Coordinates: int8_t vs int32_t
- Castling: flags vs separate booleans
- Attack checker: comparison vs SSE vs AVX
- Move gen: iterate over bitboard vs keep separate lists
- King: keep position explicitly or use bit tricks?
- isMoveValid: try different approaches for long-attacking figures
